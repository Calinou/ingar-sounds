	INGAR'S SOUND EFFECTS PACK

	http://ingar.satgnu.net/
	ingar@osirion.org

	This is a collection of sound effects based on recordings
	I created through a number of methods: some were recorded
	with a PC headset microphone, most were recorded using
	a digital audio recorder, and few were generated with
	digital synthesizer software.

	These sound effects are availble under the terms and conditions of the
	Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL). The full text 
	of the license can be found at the bottom of this document.
	For more information on this license, please refer to

	Credit is not required, but is always appreciated.
